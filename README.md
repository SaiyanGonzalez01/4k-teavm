ight look the repo is still a wip, but Legend Of The Chambered was a game released by Markus "Notch" Persson in May 24, 2008. It was created before Minecraft, and even has textures that would be used later in Minecraft, like the iron sword, leather armor, and even the armor gui texture used when no armor is equipped. The game is very short, its "ending" is just you in a room with a clock based on your computer's system time. There are 3 versions, the first one, being made in 2001, is currently lost media, the second version (this one), and the third version, being made on May 2, 2009. 

This port is for more people to experience and know about LOTC!
